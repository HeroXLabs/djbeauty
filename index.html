    <h1>Accupuncture</h1>
      <h3 class='title'>What is Acupuncture and Oriental medicine?</h3>
        <p>Acupuncture is an integral part of Oriental medicine which includes herbology, acupressure, nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle counseling. As one of the oldest, continually practiced, deliberate medicines in the world, it has evolved into a highly sophisticated system designed to cure illness and maintain health and well-being.</p>
      <h3 class='title'>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>Acupuncture and Oriental medicine work by re-establishing balance and harmony within the body. The general theory is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy called Qi that flow throughout the body. This energy circulates in a system which externally/internally ties together meridians, organs, and the tendino-muscular system. When energy flow of the human body is disrupted due to trauma, poor diet, stress, or other conditions, pain and illness result. Acupuncture seeks to correct these imbalances by inserting ultra-thin needles into specific points in the body. Stimulation of theses “acupoints” unblocks the meridians and encourages an even flow of Qi, restoring the body’s balance and relieving pain and other symptoms.</p>
      <h3 class='title'>What is Chinese Herbology?</h3>
        <p>Along with acupuncture, herbal medicine is another pillar of Oriental health care. Acupuncture and herbs share the same underlying theories and principles. Ancient Chinese formulas as are as effective now as they were when first introduced over 200 years ago. Chinese herbology is considered safe and effective when prescribed by a qualified practitioner of Oriental medicine. Modern techniques have made these formulas available in pills, capsules, powders, and tinctures. A typical formula will consist of 4 to 12 herbs, and work by targeting different aspects of a patient’s imbalance. The herbalist weighs many factors when preparing an herbal formula, the benefits of which can be substantial.</p>
      <h3 class='title'>Can Acupuncture be combined with other health care?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Although they are quite different approaches and ways of looking at the body, Oriental and Western medicine complement each other. In fact, they can be integrated to offer the patient a system of optimal health care.</p>
      <h3 class='title'>Is Acupuncture safe?</h3>
        <p>Very. In California, a licensed acupuncturist is a primary health care provider, and is a well-trained physician. The practice is safe and virtually free from side effects.</p>
      <h3 class='title'>Acupuncture has been found to help relieve the following symptoms:</h3>
        <p>Anxiety, Arthritis, Frozen shoulder, Headaches/migraines, Gastrointestinal disorders, Menopause, Sleep disorders, Skin problems, Weight control, Plus many other health problems</p>
